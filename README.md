# João Vitor Fernandes - Psicólogo

The client asked to develop a landing page for his psychology clinic.

This is a simple application, which tries to get patients to contact the clinic. The application is built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

The design was created using LLM from Figma and prompts by Google Gemini.

## Getting started

Run `./docker-up.sh dev` on folder docker-compose to deploy the application to the development environment.

In production, run `./deploy.sh` on folder scripts.
